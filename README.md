NIMBY Daemon
============

This is a daemon for linux. It toggles the NIMBY option of Tractor blades for your render farm.
To use it, copy the NIMBYDaemon.config file to the **website** directory where your Tractor Engine
is installed. The config file gives a good description for each of the configuration options.
(Warning: do not remove options from the config file, or you'll start getting errors in the log file)
